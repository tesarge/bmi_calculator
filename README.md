# bmi_calculator
This project served more as a personal challenge for myself. I wanted a chance to create something that wasn't a requirement for any coding course or program, and therefore something I would be able to plan and create entirely on my own. In this project I learned:

...How to create string literals and use them to add elements to the DOM based on users input

...How to use Git to push files into a repository

...How to use toFixed() to create rounded decimals

...How to use Tailwind CSS to whip up a pleasing interface in a jiffy

...That my BMI is a bit high and that I should do some laps around the block
